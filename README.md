# CubeSolver
Simple program to solve your rubik's cube written in python3

This program was written for Python course on my university. 
If you have rubik's cube and struggle to solve this, simply run ./main.py.

Here is how it looks like:

I have always wanted to implement algorithm for rubik's cube solving, and I decided this might be good idea for a project. But since language courses on universities require you to use libraries, make some GUI, it took me a while to code the enitre gui and I had no time to write the most interesting part (algorithm) by myself. Fortunately there was python library which implemented awesome and blazing fast algorithm: https://github.com/muodov/kociemba. One day I hope to come back to this and implement this on my own.
